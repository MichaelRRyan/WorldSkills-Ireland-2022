# WorldSkills Ireland 2022
## IT Software Solutions for Business
This repo contains the Desktop, Mobile, and Web app built over the 3 days of the WorldSkills Ireland final. With this solution, I won first place in the IT Software Solutions for Business competiton.

### A Note on Running the Solution
The desktop and web apps built for the competition use Firebase for database and authentication functionality. To protect against modification, the Firebase credentials have been placed in a secrets file, which has not been included in the repo, and as such, running the application will not run correctly.
